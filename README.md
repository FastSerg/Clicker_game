# World of Warcraft game

A user has 5 levels to win. It should click on an enemy to shoot it. Some shoots can be missed. The progress and total shots score are saved if a user completes a level. After winning the last enemy, a user can restart the game to finish the game with fewer shots.

### Technologies:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Local Storage as a DB

### How to run the app:

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/FastSerg/Clicker_game.git`
- Open in a browser the `index.html` file in the root directory of the app. Should be the latest version of a browser

### Notes:

- This app has been created in a short time so it would have many improvements
- The app uses only core JS + HTML + CSS because of requirements
- Local Storage is used as a DB so the data is valid only in one browser (because of requirements)
- User password is not hashed because of NO requirements on that, but in the real project it will be stored with hashing, and in the real remote DB
- The app has some minor bugs that will be fixed soon
